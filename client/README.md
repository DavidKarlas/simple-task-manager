# SimpleTaskManager

This is the web application of the simple task manager.
It's based on [Angular](https://angular.io) and uses `npm` as a package manager.

## Setup environment

1. Download/clone this repo and go into this client folder.
2. I assume you have `npm` installed (if not: install it using your package manager)
3. You need to globally install the Angular CLI (in oder to use the `ng` command line tool) and install the needed packages

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` to start a development server.
Then open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.
The app will automatically recompile and reload if you change any of the source files.
